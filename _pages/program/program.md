## Conference Handbook

The conference handbook can be downloaded [here](/downloads/handbook.pdf).

## Welcome Reception

A Welcome Reception will be held on **Sunday, July 10** from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. Join us at the
conference venue where you can meet and make new friends and catch up with your colleagues. Light
food and refreshments will be served.

## Social Event

The NAACL 2022 Social Event will be held on **Tuesday, July 12** from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm at the
Museum of Pop Culture (MoPOP). Housed in a building designed by architect Frank Gehry, this
museum features rotating exhibits dedicated to all things pop culture, including film, music, comic
books, and more. MoPOP’s permanent collection features more than 80,000 objects. While we add
objects to this online catalog over the coming years until the entire collection is accessible digitally,

MoPOP curators have selected iconic objects from across genres and time periods, in order to highlight
the breadth of MoPOP’s permanent collection. Visit [here](https://www.mopop.org/collection/highlights/) to learn more about MoPOP.

The Museum of Pop Culture (formerly EMP Museum) is located at 325 5th Avenue N at Seattle Center.

One entrance ticket will be included with your in-person registration. Please note that we need to plan
ahead so it is important to let us know on the registration form whether or not you plan to attend the
social event.
