## Subsidies (travel, registration, volunteership)

NAACL 2022 is providing D&I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel, VPN subsidies and volunteer opportunites. We strongly encourage researchers from developing countries and marginalized communities to apply for subsidies to maximize their chances of getting their registration fees waived. We are also seeking student and non-student volunteers for the 2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2022). 

In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, student volunteers receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and ACL membership for one year. Non-student volunteers receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials). We encourage undergraduate students as volunteers, as well as PhD and MSc students.

More details are available [here](/blog/subsidies/).

## ACL Membership

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2022) ACL member. So, in addition to the above registration fee, each Regular will add **$100** membership fee to their registration and each Student will add **$50** membership fee to their registration if not already a 2022 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

### Reduced Rate Memberships

The ACL offers a discount to members from developing countries. We hope this discount will allow for more people from these countries to become a part of the ACL and enjoy its benefits. To be able to benefit from reduced rate memberships, you need to become a member through the ACL portal. You can then register for the conference as a member. For more information follow this link: <https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/membership-fees>


## Cancellation Policy

* Cancellations received one month or more prior to the conference will receive full refund
* Cancellations received up to three weeks prior to the conference will receive the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and reimbursement of all amounts paid above the first $200  
* Cancellations received within three weeks prior to the conference and all no-shows will not receive reimbursements but will receive the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration).
* Cancellations due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa or serious illness that prevents travel to attend the Conference (including COVID-19 problems) will receive a full refund regardless of when notification is received by the ACL Registrar.

For questions about your registration and/or payment, please contact **Yes Events**: <NAACLinfo@yesevents.com> or Toll Free: +1-800-937-8728

## Code of Conduct

By registering, participants acknowledge and agree to follow the [ACL's code of ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics), the [ACL's anti-harassment policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy), and the ACL code of conduct below. Violations against those should be reported to the [Professional Conduct Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee) by approaching any of its members. The contact information for each member and the languages they speak are listed [here](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee).  

### ACL Code of Conduct

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the [Professional Conduct Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee). Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.
