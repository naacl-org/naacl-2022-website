As you prepare for the conference, here is a reminder of what you need to do if you are presenting a main conference or findings paper. We are looking forward to your presentation!


## In-person Oral Presentation

Double-check the [detailed presentation instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaQu5e7hYv5P5OjXecq_Pgcb8PnvUnldnwLOt9kqCpw/edit?usp=sharing) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials. While submitting a pre-recorded video is optional for in person oral presenters, you should make sure that you have filled in the Underline consent form. You should upload your slides at the latest by the end of the day before your presentation.  

Arrive 15 minutes prior to your session and introduce yourself to the session chair. Give your live presentation at the [scheduled time](https://2022.naacl.org/program/schedule/).

Check your paper’s page on Underline during the conference to engage with questions and comments from audience members.

You should make sure that you have filled in the Underline consent form and submitted a pre-recorded video of your talk.

Join the Zoom room linked from the Underline schedule 15 minutes before the session start. The Underline staff will be there to greet you. You will present by sharing your screen and you will have a chance to answer questions. You are advised to present live. Your pre-recording will be used as a backup.

## Main Conference Poster Presentation

Double-check the [detailed presentation instructions from Underline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SaQu5e7hYv5P5OjXecq_Pgcb8PnvUnldnwLOt9kqCpw/edit?usp=sharing) ahead of the conference to make sure you have submitted all the required materials. You should make sure that you have filled in the Underline consent form and submitted a pre-recorded video of your talk.

**All main conference posters will be presented virtually**. Join Gathertown ahead of time following the link for your session on the Underline conference schedule. To foster discussion, posters are grouped by area. In Gathertown, follow the arrows to your area, and find the stage for your group. Each poster session will start with a “1 minute madness” presentation within each group. When the session chair calls your poster, step up to the stage, share your screen and give a very brief pitch about your paper. Make sure to keep it short, the chairs are instructed to move to the next poster after 1 minute! Once the “madness” talks are over, you can leave the stage area to stand next to your poster and interact with the audience.

Check your paper’s page on Underline during the conference to engage with questions and comments from audience members.

**If you have opted to present your poster in person in addition to virtually**, your poster should be in a portrait format and fit within the 4’ width x 8’ height boards.  Each paper is assigned to a specific board to ensure that posters are grouped by area. The assignment will be displayed in the room.  Put up your poster at least 15 minutes [before the start of your session](https://2022.naacl.org/program/schedule/), and take it down at the end of your presentation. Pins will be provided. NAACL does not have poster printing services, you are responsible for making arrangements for printing your poster.
