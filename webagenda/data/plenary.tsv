"Keynote 1"	"Language corpora reflect human society, including cultural stereotypes, prejudices, and historical patterns. By default, statistical language models will absorb these stereotypes. As a result, NLP systems for word analogy generation, toxicity detection, and many other tasks have been found to reflect racial and gender biases. Based on this observation, I will discuss two emerging research directions. First, a deeper understanding of human culture can help identify possible harmful stereotypes in algorithmic systems. The second research direction is the converse of the first: if data is a mirror of society, machine learning can be used as a magnifying lens to study human culture."

"Keynote 2"	"Whether we like it or not, deception occurs everyday and everywhere: thousands of trials take place daily around the world; little white lies: “I’m busy that day!” even if your calendar is blank; news “with a twist” (a.k.a. fake news) meant to attract the readers attention or influence people in their future undertakings; misinformation in health social media posts; portrayed identities, on dating sites and elsewhere. Can a computer automatically detect deception in written accounts or in video recordings? In this talk, I will overview a decade of research in building linguistic and multimodal resources and algorithms for deception detection, targeting deceptive statements, trial videos, fake news, identity deception, and health misinformation. I will also show how these algorithms can provide insights into what makes a good lie - and thus teach us how we can spot a liar. As it turns out, computers can be trained to identify lies in many different contexts, and they can often do it better than humans do."

"Keynote 3"	"There is a chasm between an NLP technology that works well in the research lab and something that works for applications that real people use. Research conditions are often theoretical or idealized. The first time they contribute to industry projects, many theoretical researchers are surprised to discover how much goes into building outside the lab, and how hard it is to build data products for real people ethically and transparently. This talk explores my NLP journey in three stages: working as an academic NLP researcher, learning to be a practical creator of NLP products in industry, and becoming the founding CEO of an NLP business. While each role has used my background in computational linguistics in essential ways, every step has also required me to learn and unlearn new things along the way. The further I have gone in my industry career, the more critical it has become to define and work within a well-established set of principles for data ethics. This talk is for academic researchers considering industry careers or collaborations, for people in industry who started out in academia, and for anyone on either side of the divide who wants to make NLP products that real people can use."

"Careers in NLP Panel"	"The 2019 version of this panel recognizes the diversity of NLP careers today. Traditional career paths have typically led NLP researchers into academia, industrial labs, and government agencies. Today, we also see an increase in roles at startup companies and an emerging NLP practitioner role in industry that intersects with software, data, and product. The panel will discuss multiple topics including trends in NLP careers, emerging skills, prominent challenges and opportunities for cross-functional collaboration as an NLP professional in today's organizations. <a href='https://naacl2019.org/program/careerspanel#panelists' target='_blank'>Panelists</a> include <i>Judith L. Klavans (Independent)</i>, <i>Yunyao Li (IBM Research)</i>, <i>Owen Rambow (Elemental Cognition)</i>, <i>Joel Tetreault (Grammarly)</i>. Moderated by <i>Philip Resnik (University of Maryland)</i>."
