# Main Conference Schedule
On this page, you can choose the sessions (and individual papers/posters) of your choice and generate a PDF of your customized schedule.
For the best experience, use a non-mobile device with a resolution of at least 1920x1080 and a full-screen browser.
For help, simply type "?" while on the page or click on the "Help" button.

The overall schedule structure is final, but the assignment of papers to sessions and order of papers within sessions might still be modified
to accommodate the final mode of presentation (virtual or in-person) chosen by the authors.

**Regarding Virtual Poster Q&A Sessions:**
To foster discussion, virtual poster Q&A sessions will be organized into groups that bring together posters on similar themes.

All times are Pacific Daylight Time (<strong>GMT-7</strong>).
**Icons:** <i class="fa fa-user"></i> = Session Chair; <i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> = Link to PDF on ACL Anthology; <i class="fa fa-award"></i> = Paper Award.
