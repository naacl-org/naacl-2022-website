"""
A Python module to parse anthology XML files (and non-anthology
metadata TSV files, if available) to obtain authors, titles,
abstracts and, optionally, anthology URLs for papers and posters.
This code is entirely in service of producing web and app schedules
for conferences and, therefore, no other metadata is extracted.
In addition, for those papers that are in the non-anthology
metadata file, no abstracts and anthology URLs are available.
